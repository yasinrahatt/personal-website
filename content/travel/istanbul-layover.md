I had six hours between flights and a pocket of curiosity. The air smelled like roasted chestnuts as soon as I stepped outside the terminal.

I followed the ferry across the Bosphorus, watching the skyline shift between minarets and glass towers. Every few blocks there was a small tea shop with the same warm ritual: a glass, a sugar cube, and a smile from a stranger.

What I remember most is the pace. The city moved fast, but I was allowed to move slowly. It felt like a reminder that even a rushed schedule can hold a full story.
