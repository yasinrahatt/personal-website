We started hiking before sunrise, headlamps cutting through the cold. By the time the sky turned lavender, the ridge line opened into a view that felt endless.

The climb was simple but steady. Each step was a small negotiation with gravity and patience. When the sun finally broke over the peaks, the world shifted from monochrome to color in a matter of minutes.

I sat on a flat rock and listened to the wind. It was the kind of silence that makes everything else feel optional.
