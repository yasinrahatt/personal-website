Climate systems are defined by feedback loops. A warming ocean releases more heat, which shifts atmospheric patterns, which then change precipitation cycles. Each link is both cause and effect.

While reading, I kept returning to one idea: resilience comes from diversity. Ecosystems with multiple pathways for balance can absorb shocks better than those with a single dominant driver.

The lesson I carry into my own work is that small interventions can echo across larger systems. That's both a warning and an invitation to be intentional.
