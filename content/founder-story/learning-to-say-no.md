In the early months, every idea felt urgent. Partners wanted integrations, friends offered advice, and customers asked for custom features. I said yes to almost everything.

What surprised me was how quickly yes became the default. It felt generous but it diluted the product. It also diluted the team's energy. Our roadmap was a quilt of good intentions, not a coherent story.

Learning to say no was painful until I reframed it. Every no was a yes to the product's core promise. Every no gave the team back a slice of focus.

Now I keep a small checklist: does this move the mission forward, does it help the majority of users, and can we deliver it well? If not, it gets a thoughtful no.
