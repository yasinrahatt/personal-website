The first prototype was stitched together with late nights, borrowed code, and a stubborn belief that the problem mattered. It wasn't elegant, but it was honest. It answered one question: would anyone care enough to try it?

I sent it to ten people. Three replied. Two asked for a demo. One paid. That was the moment the work changed from imagination to responsibility.

Looking back, the value was not in the features. It was in the speed of learning. Each missing edge forced a conversation, and each conversation revealed a sharper version of the problem I wanted to solve.

If you are building something today, consider the smallest honest prototype you can put in front of someone. Clarity comes faster than confidence.
