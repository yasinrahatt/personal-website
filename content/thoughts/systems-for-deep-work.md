Deep work rarely happens by accident. It's usually the result of a few deliberate systems: a quiet place, a clear intention, and a rhythm that signals it's time to focus.

I keep a small checklist before starting a meaningful session. Phone on airplane mode. Calendar blocked. A notebook open with a single question to answer. The ritual is simple, but it signals that the next hour matters.

When the work is hard, the system keeps me steady. It removes the burden of deciding and lets me spend more energy doing.
