There is a version of ambition that shows up as steady practice, not constant noise. It looks like thoughtful notes, slow drafts, and the discipline to keep going when no one is clapping.

I'm drawn to builders who are quietly ambitious. They rarely brag, but their work is consistent and kind. They play the long game.

When I feel the urge to rush, I ask myself what kind of ambition I want to embody. The answer is almost always the quiet kind.
